    <string name="healthinfo_Exercise">Slim Sport</string>
    <string name="healthinfo_FoodContent">\n1. Just say no to fruit juice. Juice is fruit with the fiber removed. Not to mention, most of them are packed with sugar. Opt for the real thing instead.\n\n2. Stick to water. All of those sugary soft drinks are simply adding excess calories to your diet and to your waistline. Start drinking only water and a bit of tea and you could start seeing changes in your body very quickly. This is especially true if your a soft drink junkie.\n\n3. Create a new good habit each day. Eating often becomes a habit rather than a way to nourish ourselves. To get out of bad eating habits, it is easier to change one habit per day. I have recently started doing this and have found it to be extremely effective.\n\nOn the first day I gave up honey on my oatmeal and on the second day I converted all of my snacks to fruits and vegetables.\n\n4. Change your lifestyle. A diet is simply a way of eating. It is a long-term commitment not a one-time event. Create permanent lifestyle changes. Good habits are the key to success when it comes to maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n5. Get plenty of sleep. Your sleep time is an essential component to losing weight. Researchers have found evidence to show that better sleep habits are instrumental to the success of any weight loss plan.\n\n6. Eat 5-6 small meals per day instead of 3 big meals. Keith Klein, World-renowned nutritionist and author of “Get Lean” is quoted as saying,\n\n7. Do not avoid all fat. Yes, I know it might sound like a strange suggestion when trying to lose weight, but it is true. Our bodies need certain types of fats just to survive.\n\nThey are called essential fatty acids. You may have heard of them. They go by the name of Omegas 3, 6, and 9 and they are essential to a healthy diet.\n\n8. Add some variety to your meals. The key to success is having options. Keep your mouth happy with a variety of different meal choices.\n\n9. Get your Fiber. The inclusion of fiber into a well-balanced meal slows the digestion of the carbohydrates. This results in long-lasting energy instead of the short bursts of energy offered by simple carbohydrates.\n\n10. Slow Down… If you are looking to lose a few pounds, then simply slow down. There are so many Americans who rush through their meals. When you rush through your meal, your body does not have time to send your brain the signal that you are full, which results in overeating. Take time to enjoy your food.</string>
    <string name="healthinfo_SecretContent">\n1. Eat breakfast. People wanting to stay slim should never skip breakfast, after hours of sleeping at night; your body is forced to fast until you wake up the next morning. Skipping breakfast will eventually make you eat more during the day as you are body will demand the energy it needs for your daily functions.\n\n2. Exercise. It does not mean that you need to put on your cross trainers and hit the gym, although, it is an option. But what if you are not the type of person who goes to the gym? A simple brisk walk in the park or a few rounds around the block is enough for you to break a sweat and burn those calories. You may also consider taking dance lessons if you are up to it. Zumba classes are becoming popular if you like dancing; it is a great way to keep healthy and meet fellow baby boomers.\n\n3. Drink water. Some people mistake thirst for hunger, keeping your water bottle full and within reach will ensure that you make no mistake between the two.\n\n4. Eat more frequently. Eating more frequently in smaller portions, instead of eating three big meals a day, eat in-between meals. It does not only quash your craving for the heavily salted, oil-drenched alternatives, expecting to eat in-between meals will make you plan what you eat during the day.\n\n5. Stop eating. Your brain will tell you that you are full 15 to 20 minutes after you have been satiated, so before you order that extra helping of desert, wait for some time after a course meal. Doing this will help you avert eating an extra 100 to 300 calories in a meal. It may seem wasteful, but food on your plate does not have to be finished when you are full. Do not overindulge.\n\n6. Plan. When you shop, try to plan your meals beforehand. To save you trips to the market, plan for a week of food and store them properly in the fridge. This may entail buying fruits and vegetables that are just not ready yet until after a few days, this way you will not waste them when they wilt or become overripe. This will also avoid you going for high calorie food when you are craving.\n\n7. Have your cake and eat it too. You can eat something that you are really craving for like ice cream or cake just as long as you cut down on other things in your meal plan, like cutting down on the sugar on your tea or coffee or reducing your serving of pasta. Substitute.\n\n8. Do not diet. Stick to a meal plan that is a good balance of protein, carbohydrates and fat. Most people diet only to figure out later that they have gained it back after a few weeks. This leads to a yoyo effect on their weight.\n\n9. Start your meals with a salad. Salads compose of greens will help you cut back by as much as 12% on your calorie intake. And as greens make you feel full faster, it will help cut down on you overall food intake.\n\n10. Use spices. Spices are filled with enzymes that speed up metabolism. So next time you shop for food, be sure to include peppers and spicy sauces in your grocery list and make them readily available in the kitchen either during cooking or meals.\n</string>
